const tempText = `We are glad you joined! This is an example Getting started info, that can be included in the project's preview.

Put here whatever you want.

Check other modules, like:
- Issues List → (for now) simple view list of issues of the project.
- Board → not yet functional classic board view of the issues.
- Project settings → you can check there what options will be aviable in the future
- User settings → same here - check what will be there in the future
- Notifications → simple view of notifications, nothing special
- Feed → here will be any public notifications, send to everyone working on the project

That's the end of the Getting Started Box - feel free to check every single clickable button.

Also don't forget, that you can (at least temporarily) change the content of this TextArea!
